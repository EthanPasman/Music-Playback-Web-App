# Music-Playback-Web-App
Fully client-side web app for music playback using local files. This project uses pure JavaScript for all of the user interaction and logic, though I plan to transition this to a more fleshed-out full-stack application in the future.

You can find v1.0.0 at https://ethanpasman.github.io/Music-Playback-Web-App/
